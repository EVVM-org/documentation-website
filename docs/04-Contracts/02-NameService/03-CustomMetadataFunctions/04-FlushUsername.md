# flushUsername

:::info[Signature Verification]
This function uses **Core.sol's centralized signature verification** via `validateAndConsumeNonce()`. All NameService operations use the universal signature format with `NameServiceHashUtils` for hash generation.
:::

**Function Type**: External  
**Function Signature**: `flushUsername(address user, string memory username, address originExecutor, uint256 nonce, bytes memory signature, uint256 priorityFeeEvm, uint256 nonceEvvm, bytes memory signatureEvvm) external`

Permanently deletes a username registration and all associated data. This is **irreversible** - the username becomes immediately available for others to register. All custom metadata is deleted, ownership is reset, and the username returns to initial state (except offerMaxSlots is preserved for historical tracking).

## Parameters

| Parameter Name          | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------- |-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `user`                 | `address` | The address of the **current owner** of the `username` who is authorizing the permanent deletion.                                                                                   |
| `username`             | `string`  | The registered identity (e.g., username) to be permanently flushed from the system.                                                                                                  |
| `nonce`                | `uint256` | The **owner's (`user`)** nonce specific to the Name Service contract (`nameServiceNonce`) for this `flushUsername` action's replay protection.                                           |
| `signature`            | `bytes`   | The EIP-191 signature **from the owner (`user`)** authorizing *this flush username action*.                                        |
| `priorityFee_EVVM` | `uint256` | Optional fee (in principal tokens) paid **by the owner (`user`)** to the `msg.sender` (executor) via the EVVM contract for prioritized processing of this transaction.                   |
| `nonce_EVVM`           | `uint256` | **Required**. The **owner's (`user`)** nonce for the EVVM payment call used to pay the total calculated Flush Fee + Priority Fee.                                         |
| `priorityFlag_EVVM`        | `bool`    | **Required**. Priority flag (sync/async) for the EVVM payment call paying the fees.                                                                                         |
| `signature_EVVM`       | `bytes`   | **Required**. The **owner's (`user`)** signature authorizing the EVVM payment call to transfer the total calculated Flush Fee + Priority Fee.                           |


:::note Signature Links & EVVM Payment

- The EVVM payment signature (`signature_EVVM`) covers the **total** amount (calculated Flush Fee + `priorityFee_EVVM`) and is paid **by the identity owner (`user`)**. It uses the [Single Payment Signature Structure](../../../05-SignatureStructures/01-EVVM/01-SinglePaymentSignatureStructure.md). Since a flush fee is required, these EVVM parameters are **mandatory**.
- The Name Service flush username signature (`signature`) must be generated by the **current owner (`user`)** and follows the [Flush Username Signature Structure](../../../05-SignatureStructures/02-NameService/10-flushUsernameStructure.md).
- The flush fee is calculated as the sum of metadata flush cost plus a base username deletion fee via `getPriceToFlushUsername(username)`.

## Username Flush Pricing

The cost to flush a username is calculated dynamically based on the current EVVM reward amount and includes both metadata removal and username deletion costs:

**Flush Fee** = `((10 * getRewardAmount()) * customMetadataMaxSlots) + getRewardAmount()`

This pricing includes:
- **Metadata removal cost**: 10x reward amount per metadata entry
- **Base username deletion fee**: 1x reward amount

### Workflow

Failure at validation steps typically reverts the transaction. The steps execute **in the specified order**.

1.  **Name Service Nonce Verification**: Calls internal `verifyAsyncNonce(user, nonce)` which reverts with `AsyncNonceAlreadyUsed()` if the nonce was already used.
2.  **Identity Ownership Verification**: Checks if the provided `user` address is the registered owner of the `username`. Reverts if `user` is not the owner.
3.  **Username Expiration and Type Validation**: Validates that the username has not expired and is a valid username type:
    - Checks that `block.timestamp < identityDetails[username].expireDate` (username is still active)
    - Checks that `identityDetails[username].flagNotAUsername == 0x00` (it's a username, not another type of identity)
    - Reverts with `FlushUsernameVerificationFailed` if either condition fails.
4.  **Flush Username Signature Validation**: Verifies the `signature` provided by `user` (the owner) against the reconstructed message hash using `verifyMessageSignedForFlushUsername`. Reverts if the signature is invalid according to the [Flush Username Signature Structure](../../../05-SignatureStructures/02-NameService/10-flushUsernameStructure.md).
5.  **Payment Execution**: Calls `makePay` to transfer the payment using `getPriceToFlushUsername(username)` and `priorityFee_EVVM` of principal tokens from `user` to the service via the EVVM contract. Reverts if the payment fails.
6.  **Custom Metadata Removal**: Iterates through all metadata entries and deletes them:
    - Loops from `i = 0` to `customMetadataMaxSlots - 1`
    - Deletes each entry: `delete identityCustomMetadata[username][i]`
7.  **Reward Distribution (to Executor)**: Calls an internal helper function (`makeCaPay`) to distribute rewards in principal tokens directly to `msg.sender` (the executor). The rewards consist of:
    - 5 times the base reward amount **multiplied by the number of metadata entries** (`(5 * getRewardAmount()) * customMetadataMaxSlots`).
    - The full `priorityFee_EVVM`, if it was greater than zero and successfully paid in Step 5.
8.  **Username Registration Reset**: Resets the username registration data while preserving offer slots:
    - Sets `owner` to `address(0)`
    - Sets `expireDate` to `0`
    - Sets `customMetadataMaxSlots` to `0`
    - Preserves existing `offerMaxSlots`
    - Sets `flagNotAUsername` to `0x00` (making it available for re-registration)
9.  **Nonce Management**: Calls internal `markAsyncNonceAsUsed(user, nonce)` to mark the provided `nonce` as used and prevent replays.
