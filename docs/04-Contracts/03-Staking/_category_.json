    "description": "The Staking Service combines operational staking management with mathematical reward precision through two specialized contracts: the Staking Contract for unified user/service operations and multi-tier access, and the Estimator Contract for epoch-based, time-weighted reward calculations. This ecosystem enables both MATE token holders and smart contracts to participate as network fishers while receiving proportional rewards based on their actual staking contribution over time."
