# Introduction

## What is EVVM?

EVVM (Ethereum Virtual Virtual Machine) is a virtual blockchain system that runs on existing blockchains, giving you your own blockchain without managing infrastructure.

## Key Features

### Virtual Blockchain
- **No Infrastructure**: Deploy your blockchain without validators or nodes
- **Host Security**: Inherits security from the underlying blockchain
- **Instant Deployment**: Launch in minutes, not months
- **Vertical Scalability**: Run multiple EVVMs on one host blockchain

### Gasless Communication
- **Fishing Spots**: Use any data channel (APIs, messaging, etc.) to transmit transactions
- **Zero Gas Fees**: Transactions through alternative channels cost nothing

## Who Should Use EVVM?

### Organizations & Protocols
Deploy custom blockchain solutions without infrastructure:
- Protocols, enterprises, banks, public sector
- Custom on-chain rules and optimizations
- Blockchain-as-a-Service approach

### Developers
Three ways to build:
1. **Deploy Your Own**: Create isolated, custom blockchain environments
2. **Build Within**: Collaborate in existing EVVM ecosystems
3. **Experiment**: Test future Web3 technologies and EIPs

## Core Components

### EVVM Core Contract
Payment processing and token management:
- Dual-track system for stakers and non-stakers
- Token abstractions using EIP-191 signatures
- Cross-chain transfers via Fisher Bridge

### Name Service
Human-readable identities:
- Username registration and metadata
- Username-based payments

### Staking System
Token staking with rewards:
- Era-based deflationary rewards
- Enhanced access for stakers
- Fisher and service (smart contract) staking support

### Fisher Bridge
Cross-chain asset transfers:
- Secure multi-chain withdrawals
- Decentralized operator network
