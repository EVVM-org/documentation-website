    "description": "The Registry EVVM Contract manages the registration and discovery of EVVM instances deployed on various testnets. It implements a dual-tier registration system with public auto-incrementing IDs (1000+) for community deployments and reserved IDs (1-999) for official whitelisted deployments. The contract features time-delayed governance for security, chain ID whitelisting to prevent mainnet registration, and comprehensive metadata tracking for all registered EVVM instances."
